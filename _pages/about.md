I am a dispersal&nbsp;biogeographer. Broadly, I take a demographic perspective to study&nbsp;the role of dispersal&nbsp;in shaping ecological and evolutionary patterns, using mathematical&nbsp;and Bayesian&nbsp;models. My current work explores population biology at the margins using theoretical ideas from network science quantitative genetics, coalescent theory,&nbsp; population demography, and spread phenomenon. Click on the [Science tab](./science) to see what I do.

I am a postdoctoral researcher&nbsp;in [Mevin Hooten's lab](https://mhooten.github.io/) at the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), University of Texas,&nbsp; at Austin. Before that, I completed my Ph.D with [Tim Keitt](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/keittlab/home) at the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program), University of Texas at Austin. I received my MSc&nbsp;in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.yale.edu/) from&nbsp;Yale University. I received my [undergraduate degree](https://ug.iisc.ac.in/) in&nbsp;Physics&nbsp;and Environmental Sciences&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Indian Institute of Science,&nbsp;where I did my senior thesis on regime shifts in complex dynamical systems&nbsp;with&nbsp;[Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/).
