Organisms are continuously changing their position by moving or dispersing their propagules. This ubiquitous feature of life is responsible for generating a wide range of ecological and evolutionary patterns at population margins, including the evolution of increased dispersal rates, the spread of invasive species, and mismatched geographical and niche limits. My research aims to elucidate how dispersal generates these biogeographical patterns across scales in unison with other biological processes.â€‹
 
My research work combines both theoretical and statistical approaches. I use theory to generate empirically testable insights that allow us to unify concepts across seemingly disparate systems that are otherwise challenging. Naturally, my research relies on long walks and pen and paper. Although my research has a strong theoretical bend, I collaborate with empiricists to [test theoretical predictions] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2015.10.007).

I am a postdoctoral researcher&nbsp;in [Mevin Hooten's lab](https://mhooten.github.io/) at the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), University of Texas,&nbsp; at Austin. Before that, I completed my Ph.D with [Timothy Keitt](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/keittlab/home) at the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program), University of Texas at Austin. I received my MSc&nbsp;in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.yale.edu/) from&nbsp;Yale University. I received my [undergraduate degree](https://ug.iisc.ac.in/) in&nbsp;Physics&nbsp;and Environmental Sciences&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Indian Institute of Science,&nbsp;where I did my senior thesis on regime shifts in complex dynamical systems&nbsp;with&nbsp;[Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/).
